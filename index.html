        Demain first page<br>I cannot tell my story without going a long way back. 
        If it were possible I would go back much farther still to 
        the very earliest years of my childhood and beyond them 
        to my family origins. 
        
        When poets write novels they are apt to behave as if 
        they were gods, with the power to look beyond and com- 
        prehend any human story and serve it up as if the 
        Almighty himself, omnipresent, were relating it in all 
        its naked truth. That I am no more able to do than the 
        poets. But my story is more important to me than any 
        poet’s story to him, for it is my own — and it is the story 
        of a human being — not an invented, idealised person 
        but a real, live, unique being. What constitutes a real, 
        live human being is more of a mystery than ever these 
        days, and men — each one of whom is a valuable, unique 
        experiment on the part of nature — are shot down whole- 
        sale. If, however, we were not something more than 
        unique human beings and each man jack of us could 
        really be dismissed from this world with a bullet, there 
        would be no more point in relating stories at all. But 
        evcpy man is not only himself; he is also the unique, 
        particular, always significant and remarkable point 
        where the phenomena of the world intersect once and 
        for all and never again.
